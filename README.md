## Features

- **Millisecond-accurate synchronization**: Abstracts [NTP-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) time synchronization primitives to achieve a high degree of accuracy
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser (Chrome recommended for best performance)
- **Spatial audio:** Allows controlling device volumes through a virtual listening source for interesting sonic effects
- **Polished interface**: Smooth loading states, status indicators, and all UI elements come built-in
- **Self-hostable**: Run your own instance with a few commands


> [!NOTE]
> Beatsync is in early development. Mobile support is working, but experimental. Please consider creating an issue or contributing with a PR if you run into problems!

## Quickstart

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo). Create the client and server environment files from them included examples:

```sh
cp apps/client/.env.example apps/client/.env
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
```

The defaults run the client against `localhost:8080` and store uploads and room backups under `apps/server/data`.
No S3 bucket is required when `STORAGE_MODE=local`. To use R2/S3 instead, set `STORAGE_MODE=s3` and fill in the
`S3_*` variables in `apps/server/.env`.

For access from other computers on the same network, replace `localhost` in both environment files with the server
computer's LAN IP and ensure ports `3000` and `8080` are reachable.

Run the following commands to start the server and client:

```sh
bun install          # installs once for all workspaces
bun dev              # starts both client (:3000) and server (:8080)
```
